# Object Detection with Python

This repository contains Python code for object detection using OpenCV and NumPy, developed by Abhigyan Sati.

## Modules Required

Before you can run the code, you'll need to install the following Python modules:

### OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides various tools and libraries for computer vision tasks, including object detection.

To install OpenCV, run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python

NumPy
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

To install NumPy, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Usage
Provide instructions on how to use your code and any additional setup required.

Examples
Include examples of how to run the object detection code with sample images or videos.
